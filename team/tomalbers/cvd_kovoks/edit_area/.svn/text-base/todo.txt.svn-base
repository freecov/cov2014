/***** BUGS ****/
- on first display (when file not in cache) or with xhtml doctype there is a display bug (the content of the textarea exceed of 4px), don't know why.



/****** Lacks *****/
- Quite slower when page have other content => don't know why
- can't change font-size on IE due to the fact that for IE \t= a given width and not a given number of white spaces
- Mozilla, and opera have problems with mouse wheel (can't do anything for that)
- Mozila don't accept "width: 100%" for width of the source textarea (textarea will expend alone...)
- The resize icon have bottom-margin => don't know why (doctype xhtml)


/*** HIGHLIHTS bugs***/
- when all the content is replaced with a new one (ctrl+A and Ctrl+v ) there is a desyncronisation


/*** HIGHLIHTS Lacks***/
- not perfect
- allow to search keywords witch caracters like '$'
- only one language at the same time (no hmlt and php on the same time)

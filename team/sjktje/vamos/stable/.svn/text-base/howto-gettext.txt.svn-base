Updating language files -- sjk sjk@ankeborg.nu 06-12-11

Covide/vamos's language support consists of heavy gettext usage :). You'll often 
add new gettext statements in your code, so it's important that you update the language
files when necessary. 

We do this by using a few programs: find, xgettext, cat and msgfmt. It's not a 
difficult process. To update the Swedish language file, do the following:

cd /path/to/covide
touch gettext.patch
find . -type f -iname \*.php -exec xgettext -o gettext.patch -j -x \
lang/sv_SE/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po {} \;
 
Find searches for php files and runs xgettext which parses the files for gettext()
statements. It will ignore entries already added to lang/sv_SE/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po.
We now must do the same thing for the javascript files:

find . -type f -iname \*.js -exec xgettext -o gettext.patch -j -x \
lang/sv_SE/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po {} \;

Now, if you master the Swedish language, go ahead and edit gettext.patch. When done,
add it to the original messages.po:

cat gettext.patch >> lang/sv_SE/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po 

Now, as you may have noticed, there are two files in the LC_MESSAGES directory.
messages.po and messages.mo. The one with the .po extension is the one you edit.
The .mo one is a binary version of the .po file. To generate a bin file, use
msgfmt:

cd lang/sv_SE/LC_MESSAGES/
msgfmt -o messages.mo messages.po

Remember to do this for all language directories in lang! If you don't know 
a language, at least add the generated output from xgettext to the language
file in question and let someone else do the translating.

(You might want to rm gettext.patch when done.)

2.2. Installation / Upgrade

	2.2.1. Manual installation / Upgrade

	To install a completely new version, follow these steps:

	1. Create a new MySQL/PostgreSQL database.
	2. Create a new user for the database.
	3. Import the file sql/$DATABASE_TYPE/covide.sql into the database.
	4. Change the defines in the src/conf/offices.php file to match with the 
	   database and user names. Also change the other settings to your liking.
	5. Copy all .php files in the src/ directory to your webserver directory.
	6. Create a dir /var/covide_files and give the webserver user read/write permissions.
	7. log in with username/password covide/covide .

	For the rss feeds on the portal, you need some kind of trigger.
	We recommend using cron for this with something like:
	wget -q -r http://your.covide.url/index.php?mod=rss
	
	
	To upgrade a current version:

	See UPGRADING

	It is A Good Thing To Do (tm) to backup everything before doing this.
	
2.3. Configuring
	
	Once logged in click on the first icon right of the C on top of the screen.


3. Feedback / Contributing.

	If you wish to contribute to Covide, please read this section. It contains
	rules and guidelines for contribution. 

3.1. Feedback (bugs/questions/feature requests)

	If you've got feedback about Covide, and wish to share it, you can do so
	in a couple of ways.

	1. Send email to <support (AT) terrazur (DOT) nl>
	2. Use the tools in sourceforge
	
	The preferred way is using the sourceforge tools.

	When giving feedback, please keep these following rules in mind:

	* Be specific. If you've found a bug or have a feature request, please
	  provide the URL where you've found the bug or want the feature. Try to
	  be short but clear.
	* If you're going to report a bug, please follow the standard bug-reporting
	  guidelines. You can find a good guide to reporting bugs here:
	  http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html

3.2. Contributing

	If you wish to contribute to this project, you'll have to come up with a
	good contribution. 
	What kind of contributions is the core dev team interested in? 

	* Bug-fixing patches.
	* Feature enhancements. (Please note the 'enhancement' part.. it means the core dev team would
	  like enhancements to currently available features).
	
	Completely new features might get accepted, but don't yet bet money on it. The best
	way to go here is to first tell the core dev team about your idea. We will then let you know
	if it's likely to be included in Covide. 

	If you contribute a completely new module, we might include it in the Covide
	distribution or provide an additional download on the website for the 
	module. That way, people can still use the module but we don't have to 
	provide support for it.

	3.2.1. Writing patches/contributions.

	There are, at the moment, official coding guidelines. 
	If you need more information about those guidelines, send us an email at <support@terrazur.nl>
	and we can send them to you.
	Also look at the other sources to get an impression about code-style, layout, used functions,
	etc. 
	
	Some rules you should follow are:
	* Create patches using: diff -ruN [latest-release] [your-changes]
	  Run it in the directory which CONTAINS the covide/ directory.
	* If you can, use the following editor settings:
	  - Vim: 
		:set tabstop=2
		:set softtabstop=2
		:set shiftwidth=2
		:set noexpandtab
		:set guioptions-=T
	  - Other editors:
		Tabs should be tabs, not just a couple of spaces.
		Only use tabs at the start of a line. Use spaces eveywhere else 
		(aligning).
		Try to keep lines in sourcecode under 120 characters. If you really have to make a longer line
		that is ok, but please try to keep under it. Almost all editors have some option to place a marker
		at 120 characters so it is easier to see.

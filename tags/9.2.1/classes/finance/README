This module should be either
a) redone to match current code guidelines
b) removed in favour of reeleezee
c) totally redone, started from scratch

It's a quick hack to take parts of the Covide internal
finance module and fold it into a module that is/can be
usefull for customers.
It still has a lot of code that's not in objects and it's
scattered with Dutch comments and functionnames and variablenames.
It also lacks documentation.

First of all, BACKUP !
Make backups of your database and the folder /var/covide_files/office

All database actions described below should be executed as the owner
of the database, unless stated otherwise.

When all that is done, it's a matter of:

* dump the database as user postgres with: pg_dump -adix database_name > dumpfile.sql
* create a new database as user postgres, owned by the user you have in inc_db.php
* read the file covide_schema_6X.sql into that database.
* read the file dumpfile.sql into that database.
* read the file after_migration.sql into that database.
* dump the database as user postgres with: pg_dump database_name > new_dump.sql
* drop the new database.
* create a new database as user postgres, owned by the user you have in inc_db.php
* read the file new_dump.sql into that database as user postgres.
* open the new covide like this: http://domain/index.php?fixdb=1
* as user postgres, run a vaccuum full analyze against the new database.

You now have the new database installed.

First thing you have to do now is login an go to the email module.
This will trigger an update for the email structure in the new Covide.
This can take a long time if you have a lot of email in the archive.

When Covide tells you the migration is done, run a vaccuum full analyze against
the database, or wait till pg_autovacuum kicks in. This will give the whole
system a performance boost.

You will have a fully working covide 6.0 now.

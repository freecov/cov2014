Changes to existing modules:

[2008-02-17] svdhaar: Introduced filesystem quotas
			 Added a field to the license table                                                                                                                                                                   
			 'filesys_quota' You can set the quota for an                                                                                                                                             
			 office here. Format is: <int><modifier> where                                                                                                                                            
			 modifier can be: M or G for Megabytes and                                                                                                                                                
			 Gigabytes.                                                                                                                                                                               
			 If an office reaches quota they will be unable                                                                                                                                           
			 to upload new files to covide. The email module                                                                                                                                          
			 will ignore this quota to prevent data loss.    

[2008-03-01] svdhaar: Introduced offices.php parameter $voip["polling_interval"]
			 Added a new offices.php config directive to modify the
			 voip / chat / keepalive polling interval. This setting
			 defaults to a value of 2 (seconds). This one is introduced
			 because it is not such important on offices with both
			 has_voip and has_chat disabled, such like cms only systems.
			 A setting of 2sec on slower systems will eventually stress
			 MSIE 6/7 clients too much and will hang these browsers. If
			 this occurs, you can try raise the polling interval, i.e. to
			 30 sec.

[2008-03-01] svdhaar: Introduced offices.php parameter $virus["conf"]. This array 
			 can currently have two keys (enable_clamav | enable_fprot)
			 with values (1 | 0). This setting can be used to override 
			 the default config. When using clamav I recommend using
			 package clamav-daemon and replace clamscan by clamdscan 
			 inside /usr/bin. The performance gain is 1000% or more ;)

[2008-03-17] svdhaar: Added support for SMTP AUTH and custom smtp settings.
			 Set this example inside offices.php and enjoy:
 
			$smtp = array(
				"server_hostname" => "localhost",
				"server_port"     => 24,
				"server_timeout"  => 60,
				"helo"            => "covide.localhost",
				"auth_enable"     => 1,
				"auth_username"   => "my_username",
				"auth_password"   => "my_password"
			);

[2008-03-23] mvanbaak: added extra parameter to getPageData and getPageTitle.
             When set to 0, it wont do hostname removal in page data. This allows
			 you to use your full webaddress in a page.

			 For example, you are writing a HOWTO and point to some files people can
			 download from your website with wget. Without this parameter you will see:
			 'wget "/savefile/<id>/<filename>"'.
			 If you set this parameter to 0 you will see:
			 'wget "http://your.website.url/savefile/<id>/<filename>"'

			 The default is to strip those hostnames (as it always was)
[2008-04-03] svdhaar: Introduced $html['no_static_gzip_compression'] to disable
			gzipped file creations inside the tmp folder. Background:
			apache2.2 with mod_deflate enabled and correct mem_cache
			setup does exactly the same. Also, with this setting, no
			changes with mimetype negition are needed. I suggest 
			making the no-gzip behavior the default one and to 
			introduce a new variable named $html['use_static_gzip_compression']

[2008-04-04] mvanbaak: You can now do: echo $template->displayPoll()
			Without pollid it will take the latest active poll.
			You can still use the pollid parameter to select a specific poll.

[2008-04-27] mvanbaak: Applied patch submitted by Thomas GÃ¶ttgens:
			The sms functionality is now no longer Bayhamsystems only.
			See documentation/README.smsgate for 2 examples

[2008-04-30] svdhaar:  Introduced cms page setting on the source edit view. You can now
			set a page to be edited in source view by default, rather than
			the wysiwyg editor. This is useful for pages with scripts/html 
			which will be broken after saving inside the editor.
